## About Me
- I am relatively new to programming and am in the process of exploring various areas of information technology and computer science. The bulk of my projects will be Java/Python-based, with a few exceptions; I am trying to slowly learn both, but I will not hesitate to use/learn another language if it means greatly simplifying a task at hand.<br>
- My hope is that someday my projects may be of use to other people.

## Interests
Besides computer programming, I am interested in skateboarding and literature. Feel free to approach me with a discussion on either and I will gladly respond and/or give my take.
